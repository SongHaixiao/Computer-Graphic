# CH 01 INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER GRAPHICS

[toc]

## **What is Computer Graphics?**

- Synthesis of graphical images
- Visualization : creating an image from an abstarct, symbolic description(MODEL).
- Generation of Synthesis Image:
  - using graphical primitives
  - data from real world phenomena

## Image Processing and Analysis

- Image Processing : transformation of an already existing image into a more desirable or useful image.
- Image Analysis(Computer Vision): extracting symbolic information from the image.

## **Terminology**

- Imaging = representing 2D images
- Modeling = representing 3D objects
- Rendering = constructing 2D images from 3D models
- Animation = simulating changes over time

## Why Computer Graphics?

- Humans communicate well with images.
  - 1/3 of brain is devoted to visual processing.
- A picture is worth a few hundred words.

## History of Computer Graphics

- 1950's :
  - First military applications of graphics(Whirlwind project at the MIT - use a light pen)

- 1960's:
  - Popularization of the storage tube by Tektronix storage-tube display terminal 

- mid 1960’s:
  - Sketchpad interactive drawing system by Ivan Sutherland 1963
  - Introduction of interactive computer graphics
  - Data structures for storing symbol hierarchies
  - Steve Coons - surface patch techniq

- 970's: 
  - Raster displays
  - Graphics Algorithms(Modeling, Viewing, Shading)
- 1977: Apple II
  - Graphics on Personal Computer

- early 1980s : 
  - Introduction of PC(Macintosh, IBM PC)
  - Graphics Workstations are more common

- mid 1980's : 
  - Emergence of graphics standards (PHIGS, GKS)

- late 1980's : 
  - Evolution of advanced GUI's and visualization environments
  - X window, MS windows

- 1990's: 

  - Low price, high performance
  - Increasing demand for higher quality graphics
  - Real-time Computer Graphics
  - Web-based Computer Graphics
  - General purpose graphics hardware
  - A lot of applications
  - virtual reality, games, movies, etc. 
  - OpenGL (1992), Toy Story by Pixar (1995)

- 2000's: 

  - OpenGL, DirectX

  - GPU

    nVidia, explain parallel processing on GPU’s

  - Shader Languag
